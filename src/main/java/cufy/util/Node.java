/**
 * A node is a none-centralized data point floating in space and building a structure by
 * relating to other nodes.
 * <br>
 * <div style="padding: 10px">
 *     <h3>Nodes and links</h3>
 *     Nodes uses {@link Link}s as bridge between another. They use {@link Link} like a
 *     disposal item, once they finish from them, they forget them. Unused links are
 *     safely garbage collected because they are not referenced by their previous users.
 *     A node shares a strict relation between it and every link pointing to them. At
 *     standard circumstances (with no cheating) a node have all the links pointing to it
 *     and have no link not pointing to it.
 * </div>
 * <div style="padding: 10px">
 *     <h3>Yuck relationship</h3>
 *     Nodes do not like to directly touch each other. They use links to have a
 *     relationship. So, when a node wants to have a relation or remove a relation with
 *     another node, it deals with the link responsible for that relation (on its side)
 *     and that link will obey it. This way, the node do not have to ask the other node
 *     to accept it or leave it.
 * </div>
 * <div style="padding: 10px">
 *     <h3>Garbage Links</h3>
 *     A node is not allowed to just remove the links it contains without a command from
 *     the user. Even if a link in a node is pointing to nothing in the other side. The
 *     node is not allowed to remove itself from that link (internally).
 * </div>
 * <div style="padding: 10px">
 *     <h3>Opposite Keys</h3>
 *     Aside from link-related operations, the Node interface provides the main interface
 *     functions that accept keys with a flipped behaviour. Like, when checking if a key
 *     is in a node. The check will be performed on the opposite of that key. This way,
 *     the user will not be confused by the node's side links and the relatives side of
 *     the links. For example, calling {@code node.containsKey(LEFT)} will check if this
 *     node has a node left to it instead of checking if the node is on the left of
 *     another node.
 * </div>
 * <div style="padding: 10px">
 *     <h3>One to Many / Many to Many relations</h3>
 *     It is a bit tricky to support one-to-many and many-to-many relations. I deeply
 *     thought about hardly integrate it in the interface. But, if we need to hardly
 *     integrate it in the interface, we have to either lose the strict relationships
 *     feature or make the interface more complex (which is a problem we already have).
 *     So, to support one-to-many and many-to-many relations, you need to depend on the
 *     {@link Key}s. The keys of the same class that support such relations might make
 *     their {@link Key#equals(Object)} a reference based equation. This way, a node might
 *     have multiple nodes relating to it with the same key class but with an unequal keys.
 * </div>
 * <div style="padding: 10px">
 *     <h3>Viewing Points</h3>
 *     Aside from the actual data structure (since it is implementation specific) a node
 *     has many viewing points (described below):
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>
 *             <b>Self</b>
 *             The view of the node itself. The value of the node.
 *         </li>
 *         <li>
 *             <b>Links</b>
 *             The most important viewing point viewing the links pointing to the node.
 *         </li>
 *         <li>
 *             <b>Nodes</b>
 *             An additional flipped viewing point viewing the nodes relating to the node.
 *             This view point is good to access the relationship between the node and a
 *             specific node regardless of the kind of the relationship.
 *         </li>
 *         <li>
 *             <b>Keys</b>
 *             An additional flipped viewing point viewing the opposite of the keys the
 *             node has.
 *             This view point is to treat the node as a Map with the keys being the
 *             opposite of the keys the node has.
 *         </li>
 *     </ul>
 * </div>
